title: "Getting to know your data"
teaching: 30
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How to connect to database with python?"
- "What is in the database?"
- "What are common datatypes in SQL?"
objectives:
- "Load the database"
- "Learn how to run query in python"
- "Learn what is in the database"
- "Define SQLite data types."

keypoints:
- "SQL allows us to select and group subsets of data, do math and other calculations, and combine data."
- "A relational database is made up of tables which are related to each other by shared keys."
- "Different database management systems (DBMS) use slightly different vocabulary, but they are all based on the same ideas."

## Setup

_Note: this should have been done by participants before the start of the workshop._

See [Setup](/sql-ecology-lesson/setup/) for
instructions on how to download the data, and also how to install and open SQLite Manager.

## Import

Before we get started with writing our own queries, we'll load the data into the database. 
We'll need the following file: 
* `soda.db` <br>

## Dataset Description

The data we will be using soda sells data. It contains invoice information about soda purchase from soda makers (vendors) by retail stores. 
The data was originated from a real dataset. We have modofied the dataset for this workshop. For example, soda names are completely fictitious, and price was also normalized.  

1. In an jupyter notebook cell, put in the following code to import sqlite3 and pandas modules:  
```
import sqlite3 as sql
import pandas as pd
```

`sqlite3` will be included within a standard Python installation.  `pandas` is not part of the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), but will normally be bundled with Anaconda.

2. in the next cell, create a connection to the database called conn  
```
conn = sql.connect('soda.db')
```
3. In the next cell, write your query as string called "q" (you can call it whatever you want). The follwing example is to select everything in a table called item:  
```
q = '''
SELECT * FROM item_info;
'''
```
4. The pandas package in Python has a built in function to [read sql](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/generated/pandas.read_sql.html).
The following code will execute the query and assign the result to a DataFrame variable called "df", and show the result (use .head(10) to show first 10 result, you can remove that part to show the full result): 
```
df = pd.read_sql(q, conn)
df.head(10)
``` 
5. To run a diffierent query, you can just change the query string between `''' '''` and run the code above again.  

You just ran your first SQL query! Now, lets see what's in the database 

Here are all the attributes in the database:

*SQLite does not have a separate storage class for storing dates and/or times, but SQLite is capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL or INTEGER values. In the database we used today, the date attribute is stored as text in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. 

## <a name="datatypediffs"></a> SQL Data Type Quick Reference

Different databases offer different choices for the data type definition.

The following table shows some of the common names of data types between the various database platforms:

| Data type                                               | Access                    | SQLServer            | Oracle             | MySQL          | PostgreSQL    |
|:--------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------|:---------------|:--------------|
| boolean                                                 | Yes/No                    | Bit                  | Byte               | N/A            | Boolean       |
| integer                                                 | Number (integer)          | Int                  | Number             | Int / Integer  | Int / Integer |
